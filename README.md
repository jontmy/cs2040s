## Introduction to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning ##

> This module introduces basic concepts in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). It adopts the perspective that planning, games, and learning are related types of search problems, and examines the underlying issues, challenges and techniques. Planning/games related topics include tree/graph search, A* search, local search, and adversarial search (e.g., games). Learning related topics include supervised and unsupervised learning, model validation, and neural networks.

This repository contains my personal notes for each topic covered by CS2109S. **Tutorials, problem sets, and module content in general will *not* be uploaded here.**
